Punjab-based self-styled preacher Bajinder Singh found himself in fresh controversy after a video allegedly showing him assaulting a woman surfaced online.  The footage of the incident has now gone viral. It shows Singh, who is involved in multiple sexual harassment cases, throwing a pile of papers at a woman seated with a child in his office. Moments later, as she approaches him, he appears to push her. The situation quickly escalates, with others in the room intervening to prevent a further altercation.  The video, shared by journalist Gagandeep Singh, ends as both of them were seen continuing their heated exchange. The new video came a week after Singh appeared in a Mohali court alongside six others in connection with a 2018 sexual harassment case. On March 3, non-bailable warrants were issued against him.  Singh, who runs a church in Majri, was first arrested on July 20, 2018, at Delhi airport while attempting to board a flight to London. He is accused of raping a woman from Zirakpur, who had alleged that Singh lured her into his religious circle in 2017 before sexually assaulting her at his Mohali residence.  According to police, he also recorded the act and later used the footage to blackmail her into silence. She eventually lodged a complaint in April 2018 after which Singh went into hiding.  More trouble followed on March 2 this year, when a separate FIR for sexual harassment was filed against Singh in Jalandhar. While he remains out on bail in the Zirakpur case, he has yet to be taken into custody for the latest charges.
